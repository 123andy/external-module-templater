# External Module Templater

This EM provides a control-center link for the creation of new EM templates.  The goal is to be able to quickly prop up
a skeleton structure for making a new External Module

## Instructions:
1. Download the repository and extract so the "external_module_templater_vx.x" folder is in the redcap/modules folder of your web server.
2. This module uses composer -- if you use an official release, you should be fine.  However, if you download from source, you will have to enter the external module directory and execute `composer install` to add the required libraries.
3. In Control Center > External Modules, enable "External Module Templater - vx.x"
3. Refresh the Control Center and click "Generate External Module Template" link at under "External Modules" header of the sidebar.
4. Fill out the form and click "Generate External Module Template" button at the bottom of the page.
   * If you get an error when enabling the module, see step 2 to confirm you have a /vendor folder in your external module directory
5. Your browser should now download a .zip containing at minimum:
	* a PHP class/module file
	* a README.md file
	* a config.json file
